![hello](/images/IMG_9773.jpg){: .align-right width="400px"}
I am a Courant Instructor and Simons postoctoral fellow on Wave Turbulence at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University.

I study nonlinear dispersive equations with a focus on ocean waves: surface gravity waves at the free surface and internal inertia-gravity waves in the interior, with the aim of understanding, explaining, and predicting measurable oceanic phenomena.


I completed my PhD in theoretical physics at the [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/) under the wonderful guidance of [Prof. Gregory Falkovich](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/falkovich/home).


I am married to [Daniel Halperin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=atuZWDsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) and mother of Nur and Farran.
