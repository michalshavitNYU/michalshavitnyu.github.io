I am a Courant Instructor and a Simons postdoctoral fellow in Wave Turbulence at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University.

I study nonlinear dispersive equations with a focus on ocean waves: surface gravity waves at the free surface and internal inertia-gravity waves in the interior, aiming to understand, explain, and predict measurable oceanic phenomena.

My current research is divided into four projects:
1. Weak turbulence of internal inertia-gravity waves
2. Searching for high-amplitude water waves with physics-informed neural networks
3. The spatio-temporal spectrum of surface gravity waves 
4. Well posedness of the Leith model around the turbulent solution

My reserach is supported by [Schmidt Sciences](https://www.schmidtsciences.org/israeli-womens-postdoctoral-award/) and by a [Postdoctoral Career Development Award in Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/women-in-science/resources-awards-scholarships/womens-postdoctoral-career-development-award-science/application-info) from the Weizmann Institute. 

I completed my PhD in theoretical physics at the [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/) under [Prof. Gregory Falkovich](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/falkovich/home), sponsored by the [Ariane de Rothschild Women’s Doctoral Program](https://www.edmondderothschildphilanthropy.org/womens-doctoral-program/). 
I completed an MSc in High Energy Physics under Profs. [Yosef Nir](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/particle/nir/home) and Kfir Blum, and a BSc in Mathematics with the [Technion Excellence Program](https://excellence.technion.ac.il/alumni/).

I am married to [Daniel Halperin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=atuZWDsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra).
