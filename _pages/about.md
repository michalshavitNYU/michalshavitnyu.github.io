<!--![hello](/images/IMG_9773.jpg){: .align-right width="400px"} -->



I am a Courant Instructor and a Simons postdoctoral fellow in Wave Turbulence at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University.

I study nonlinear dispersive equations with a focus on ocean waves: surface gravity waves at the free surface and internal inertia-gravity waves in the interior, aiming to understand, explain, and predict measurable oceanic phenomena.

My current research is divided into four projects:
1. Weak turbulence of internal inertia-gravity waves
2. Looking for high-amplitude water waves with physics-informed neural networks
3. The spatio-temporal spectrum of surface gravity waves 
4. Well posedness of the Leith model around the turbulent solution

I completed my PhD in theoretical physics at the [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/) under [Prof. Gregory Falkovich](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/falkovich/home), sponsored by the [Ariane de Rothschild Women’s Doctoral Program](https://www.edmondderothschildphilanthropy.org/womens-doctoral-program/). 

I am married to [Daniel Halperin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=atuZWDsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) and mother of Nur and Farran.
